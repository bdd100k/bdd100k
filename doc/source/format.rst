Label Format
=============

This is compatible with the labels generated by
`Scalabel <https://www.scalabel.ai/>`_. The labels are released in `Scalabel Format
<https://doc.scalabel.ai/format.html>`_. A label
`json <https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml>`_ file is a list
of frame objects with the fields below. Please note that this format is a
superset of the data fields. For example, `box3d` may be absent if the label is
a 2d bounding box, and `intrinsics` may not appear if the exact camera
calibration is unknown.

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

BDD100K dataset has some specific properties.

Frame attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

    - weather: "rainy|snowy|clear|overcast|undefined|partly cloudy|foggy"
    - scene: "tunnel|residential|parking lot|undefined|city street|gas stations|highway|"
    - timeofday: "daytime|night|dawn/dusk|undefined"

Label attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

    - occluded: boolean
    - truncated: boolean
    - trafficLightColor: "red|green|yellow|none"
    - areaType: "direct | alternative" (for driving area)
    - laneDirection: "parallel|vertical" (for lanes)
    - laneStyle: "solid | dashed" (for lanes)
    - laneTypes: (for lanes)


.. _seg mask:

Semantic Segmentation Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide labels for **semantic segmentation** and **drivable area** in both JSON and **mask** formats.
The mask format save the ground-truch of each image into an one-channel png (8 bits per pixel).
The value of each pixel represents its category. 255 usually means "ignore".


.. _lane mask:

Lane Marking Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For lane marking, there are three sub-tasks: lane categories, lane direction and lane styles.
A one-channel png file is used for each image to store all classes information.
The format for a pixel is defined as the image below.
The **3-th** bit and the **4-th** bit are for **direction** and **style**.
The **last 3** bits are for **category**.
Most importantly, the **5**-th bit is to indicate whether this pixel belongs to the **background** (0: lane, 1: background).

.. _bitmask:

Instance Segmentation Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide labels for **instance segmentation**, **panoptic segmentation** and **segmentation tracking** in both JSON and **bitmask** formats.
Note that ``poly2d`` used in JSONs is not of the same format as COCO. Instead, the ``poly2d`` field stores a Bezier Curve with vertices and control points.
In the bitmask format, labels for each image are stored in an **RGBA** png file.

**The evaluation scripts use bitmasks as ground-truth, so we suggest using bitmasks as input all the way.**
We expect each pixel only corresponds to one predicted class, ``poly2d`` cannot guarantee that, while bitmasks can assure that.

For the RGBA image, The first byte, R, is used for the category id range from 1 (0 is used for the background).
Moreover, G is for the instance attributes. Currently, four attributes are used, they are "truncated", "occluded", "crowd" and "ignore".
Note that boxes with "crowd" or "ignore" labels will not be considered during testing.
The above four attributes are stored in least significant bits of G. Given this, ``G = (truncated << 3) + (occluded << 2) + (crowd << 1) + ignore``
. Finally, the B channel and A channel store the "ann_id" for instance segmentation and "ann_id" for segmentation tracking, respectively, which can be computed as ``(B << 8) + A``. The below image is for reference.

Format Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coordinate System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During our labeling, we regard the left-top corner of the most left-top pixel as (0, 0),
so in our conversion scripts, the width is computed as :code:`x2 - x1 + 1`,
and height is computed as :code:`y2 - y1 + 1`. This manner also influence the mIoU calculation.
This manner is consistent with `pycocotools <https://pypi.org/project/pycocotools/>`_,
`MMDetection 1.x <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/releases/tag/v1.2.0>`_ and
`maskrcnn-benchmark <https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark>`_.
Note that, 
`MMDetection 2.x <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection>`_ and
`Detectron2 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2>`_ adopt a different manner.
You need to take care when using them.


from_coco
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``from_coco`` converts coco-format json files into bdd100k format.
Currently, for conversion of segmentation, only the ``polygon`` format is supported.

Available arguments:
::
    
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.from_coco -l ${input_file} -o ${out_path}  


to_mask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
You can run the conversion from poly2d to masks/bitmasks by this command:
::
    
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_mask -m sem_seg|ins_seg|seg_track -l ${in_path} -o ${out_path} [--nproc ${process_num}]

- `process_num`: the number of processes used for the conversion. Default as 4.

However, as the conversion process is not deterministic, we don't recommend converting it by yourself.


to_color
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run the conversion from masks/bitmasks to colormaps by this command:
::
    
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_color -m sem_seg|ins_seg|seg_track -l ${in_path} -o ${out_path} [--nproc ${process_num}]

- `process_num`: the number of processes used for the conversion. Default as 4.

 
to_coco
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``to_coco`` converts bdd100k json files into coco format.

Available arguments:

::
   
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_coco -m det|box_track -l ${in_path} -o ${out_path}  

For instance segmentation and segmentation tracking, converting from "JOSN + Bitmasks" and from "Bitmask" are both supported.
For the first choice, use this command:

::
   
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_coco -m ins_seg|seg_track -l ${in_path} -o ${out_path} -mb ${mask_base}

- `mask_base`: the path to the bitmasks

If you only have Bitmasks in hand and don't use the `scalabel_id` field, you can use this comman:

::
   
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_coco -m ins_seg|seg_track -l ${mask_base} -o ${out_path}

- `mask_base`: the path to the bitmasks
