Label Format
===========

This is compatible with the labels generated by
`Scalabel <https://www.scalabel.ai/>`_. The labels are released in `Scalabel Format
<https://doc.scalabel.ai/format.html>`_. A label
`json <https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml>`_ file is a list
of frame objects with the fields below. Please note that this format is a
superset of the data fields. For example, `box3d` may be absent if the label is
a 2d bounding box, and `intrinsics` may not appear if the exact camera
calibration is unknown.

BDD100K dataset has some specific properties.

Frame attributes

.. code-block:: yaml

    - weather: "rainy|snowy|clear|overcast|undefined|partly cloudy|foggy"
    - scene: "tunnel|residential|parking lot|undefined|city street|gas stations|highway|"
    - timeofday: "daytime|night|dawn/dusk|undefined"

Label attributes

.. code-block:: yaml

    - occluded: boolean
    - truncated: boolean
    - trafficLightColor: "red|green|yellow|none"
    - areaType: "direct | alternative" (for driving area)
    - laneDirection: "parallel|vertical" (for lanes)
    - laneStyle: "solid | dashed" (for lanes)
    - laneTypes: (for lanes)


Road object categories:

.. code-block:: json

    [
        "bike",
        "bus",
        "car",
        "motor",
        "person",
        "rider",
        "traffic light",
        "traffic sign",
        "train",
        "truck"
    ]


They are labeld by `box2d`.

Drivable area category is `drivable area`. There are two area types `areaType`:

.. code-block:: json

    [
        "alternative",
        "direct"
    ]


Lane marking category is `lane`. There are 8 lane types `laneTypes`:

.. code-block:: json

    [
        "crosswalk",
        "double other",
        "double white",
        "double yellow",
        "road curb",
        "single other",
        "single white",
        "single yellow"
    ]


Both drivable areas and lane markings are labeled by `poly2d`. Please check the
visulization code |vis_labels|_ for examples of
drawing all the labels.

.. |vis_labels| replace:: ``bdd100k.vis.labels``
.. _vis_labels: https://github.com/bdd100k/bdd100k/blob/master/bdd100k/vis/labels.py

The labels for semantic segmentation are encoded in the field ``train_id`` defined in |bdd100k_label|_,
e.g. car should be 13.

.. |bdd100k_label| replace:: ``bdd100k.label.label``
.. _bdd100k_label: https://github.com/bdd100k/bdd100k/blob/master/bdd100k/label/label.py

Instance Segmentation
~~~~~~~~~


We provide labels in both JSON and bitmask formats.

Note that ``poly2d`` used in JSONs is not of the same format as COCO. Instead, the ``poly2d`` field stores a Bezier Curve with vertices and control points.

For segmentation labels, besides JSON files contain the ``poly2d`` field, we also provide bitmasks labels.
In this format, labels for each image are stored in an **RGBA** png file.

**The evaluation scripts use bitmasks as ground-truth, so we suggest using bitmasks as input all the way.**
We expect each pixel only corresponds to one predicted class, ``poly2d`` cannot guarantee that, while bitmasks can assure that.

For the RGBA image, The first byte, R, is used for the category id range from 1 (0 is used for the background).
Moreover, G is for the instance attributes. Currently, four attributes are used, they are "truncated", "occluded", "crowd" and "ignore".
Note that boxes with "crowd" or "ignore" labels will not be considered during testing.
The above four attributes are stored in least significant bits of G. Given this, ``G = 8 & truncated + 4 & occluded + 2 & crowd + ignore``
. Finally, the B channel and A channel store the "ann_id" for instance segmentation and "ann_id" for segmentation tracking, respectively, which can be computed as ``B * 256 + A``. The below image is for reference.

Label conversion
~~~~~~~~~

from_coco
-----------------

``from_coco`` converts coco-format json files into bdd100k format.
Currently, for conversion of segmentation, only the ``polygon`` format is supported.

Available arguments:
::
    
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.from_coco -l ${input_file} -o ${out_path}  


to_bitmasks
-----------------
 
You can run the conversion from poly2d to bitmasks (and colormaps) by this command:
::
    
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_bitmasks -m sem_seg|ins_seg|seg_track -l ${in_path} -o ${out_path} --nproc ${process_num} [-cm -cp ${color_path}]
- `process_num`: the number of processes used for the conversion. Default as 4.
- `color_path`: the path to the output colormaps

However, as the conversion process is not deterministic, we don't recommend converting it by yourself.


to_coco
-----------------

``to_coco`` converts bdd100k json files into coco format.

Available arguments:

::
   
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_coco -m det|box_track -l ${in_path} -o ${out_path}  

For instance segmentation and segmentation tracking, converting from "JOSN + Bitmasks" and from "Bitmask" are both supported.
For the first choice, use this command:

::
   
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_coco -m ins_seg|seg_track -l ${in_path} -o ${out_path} -mb ${mask_path}
- `mask_path`: the path to the bitmasks

If you only have Bitmasks in hand and don't use the `scalabel_id` field, you can use this comman:

::
   
    python3 -m bdd100k.label.to_coco -m ins_seg|seg_track -l ${mask_path} -o ${out_path}
